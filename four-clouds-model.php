                    <p>Um, heat, energy, brightness, warmth, radiance, sparkling happiness, Vitamin D (uh of course). Now think what would happen if there’s a cloud that goes around the sun?</p>
                    <p>Um, well, it would block the sunlight, warmth, brightness, heat and basically you would lose the sight of the sun. You wouldn’t be able to see it.
So now taking the same metaphor of this sun and the dark cloud. Let’s shift your focus to the 4 clouds that stop us from living an awesome life and create energy leaks in our being that rob us of all our power and eventually puts us in a Stuck Phase.</p>

                        <p>In our NLP trainings we go deep in working with you and your 4 clouds to come out the other side into paradise. NLP is all about reprogramming our mind in such a way that it starts perceiving things differently and more positively  which would ultimately be result in an empowering mindset and behaviors. </p>
